Hello and Welcome to the prototype THREEJS portfolio for an IXD7 student, Kenneth KÃ¸pke.


    For moving left and right please use the left- and rightarrows on your keyboard.

    to the right you will find three mini projects developed throughout this 7. semester.

    you can move faster or slower by changing size by using up- and downarrows

    Press C for color change :-)

    if the screen size is weird, try press F11 and then F5
